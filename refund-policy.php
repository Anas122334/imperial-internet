    <p class="">We have a 15-day return policy, so you have 15 days from receiving an item to submit a return request.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold">IMPORTANT Note: Activation Fees Are Non Refundable</p>
    <p class="">Your item must be unworn or unused, with tags still attached, and in the original packaging to be eligible for a return. The invoice or other evidence of purchase is also required.</p>
    <p class="">To start a return, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:Info@imperialinternet.com" class="text-dark"></a>. Please note that returns will need to be sent to the following address: 869 Walnut St Macon, GA 31201</p>
    <p class="">We'll provide a return postage label and shipping instructions if your return is approved. We will only accept items that are sent back to us after first requesting a refund.</p>
    <p class="">Any return-related inquiries can be sent to us  at <a href="mailto:Info@imperialinternet.com" class="text-dark">Info@imperialinternet.com</a>.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold mt-3">Issues and damages</p>
    <p class="">Please check your order when it arrives and let us know immediately if anything is broken, damaged, or defective so we can look into it and make it right.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold mt-3">Items that are exempt or not returnable</p>
    <p class="">Custom products (such as special orders or personalized items) are examples of things that cannot be returned. If you have inquiries or concerns about a particular item, do get in touch.</p>
    <p class="">Unfortunately, discounted items and gift cards cannot be returned.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold mt-3">Exchanges</p>
    <p>Returning the item you own and then making a new purchase for the desired item after the return has been approved is the quickest way to ensure you get what you want.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold mt-3">Refunds</p>
    <p>Once we've received and reviewed your return, we'll let you know whether or not the refund has been accepted. Within ten business days, if accepted, your initial payment method will be instantly returned. Please remember that your bank or credit card provider may need additional time to process and deposit the refund.</p>
    <p>If it has been over 15 business days since we authorized your return, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:Info@imperialinternet.com" class="text-dark">Info@imperialinternet.com</a>.</p>
